/*    ClickButton
 
 A library that decodes multiple clicks on one button.
 Also copes with long clicks and click-and-hold.
 
 Usage: ClickButton buttonObject(pin [LOW/HIGH, [CLICKBTN_PULLUP]]);
 
  where LOW/HIGH denotes active LOW or HIGH button (default is LOW)
  CLICKBTN_PULLUP is only possible with active low buttons.
 
 Returned click counts:

   A positive number denotes the number of (short) clicks after a released button
   A negative number denotes the number of "long" clicks
   A positive number (100 + number of clicks) denotes when a button was released
 
NOTE!
 This is the OPPOSITE/negative of click codes from the last pre-2013 versions!
 (this seemed more logical and simpler, so I finally changed it)

 Based on the Debounce example at arduino playground site

 History:
 2013.08.29 - Some small clean-up of code, more sensible variable names etc.
                Added another example code for multiple buttons in an object array
 2013.04.23 - A "minor" debugging: active-high buttons now work (wops)!
                Thanks goes to John F. H. for pointing that out!
 2013.02.17 - Some improvements, simplified click codes.
				Added a LED fader example. Thanks to Tom K. for the idea.
 2012.01.31 - Tiny update for Arduino 1.0
 2010.06.15 - First version. Basically just a small OOP programming exercise.
